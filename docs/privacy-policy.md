# Privacy Policy

**Jiji Purinto (ジジプリント)**

*Last updated: January 2026*

## Overview

Jiji Purinto is a simple photo printing app for thermal mini-printers. We respect your privacy and designed this app to work entirely offline without collecting any personal data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.**

The app does not:
- Collect personal information
- Track your usage or behavior
- Send any data to external servers
- Use analytics or advertising SDKs
- Require account registration

## Device Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:

### Photo Library Access (Write Only)
- **Purpose:** To save processed/dithered images to your photo gallery
- **Usage:** When you use the Share feature to save an image, the app requests permission to add it to your Photos
- **Note:** Photo selection uses the system photo picker — the app does not have access to browse your photo library. The system provides only the specific photos you select.

### Bluetooth Access
- **Purpose:** To discover and connect to compatible thermal printers (Cat/MX series)
- **Usage:** Bluetooth is used solely for communication with the printer
- **Data transmitted:** Only processed image data is sent to the printer

## Data Processing

All image processing (resizing, dithering, format conversion) happens locally on your device. No images or data leave your device except to the connected printer.

## Third-Party Services

This app does not integrate any third-party services, SDKs, or APIs.

## Children's Privacy

This app is designed to be simple enough for young children to use. We do not collect any data from users of any age.
